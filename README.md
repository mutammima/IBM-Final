Spring 2024

This project is the final capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, focusing on predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landings. The goal is to analyze past launch data and build machine learning models to determine whether a Falcon 9 booster will land successfully, contributing to cost reduction in space exploration.

Project Highlights:

- Data Collection & Wrangling: Web scraping and API usage to gather launch data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and insights through visualization.
- Geospatial Visualization: Mapping launch sites with interactive Folium maps.
- Predictive Modeling: Building classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict landing outcomes.
- Dashboard & Reporting: Creating an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard to present findings
